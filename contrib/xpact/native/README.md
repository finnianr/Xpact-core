# xpact Native Export Layer

This directory contains the native `include/xpact.h` export layer.

The current layer is intentionally bridge-only. It exports the libexpat-shaped
public symbols, preserves the C callback ABI, and forwards parser operations to
an Eiffel-owned bridge registered through `XPACT_SetEiffelBridge`.

It must not implement XML tokenization, entity expansion, validation, or parser
state in C. Those semantics belong to the Eiffel parser classes under `src/`.
The Eiffel-side target for this bridge is `XP_NATIVE_PARSER`, with
`XP_NATIVE_CALLBACK_HANDLER` adapting parser events to Expat-style callback
slots. `XP_NATIVE_BRIDGE_INSTALLER` owns the Eiffel runtime handles that the
runtime trampoline calls: it creates `XP_NATIVE_PARSER` instances, maps opaque
native handles back through Eiffel object ids, forwards handler setters, and
supports both direct `XML_Parse` bytes and `XML_GetBuffer` / `XML_ParseBuffer`
style input. `xpact_eiffel_runtime_bridge.c` is that trampoline; it adopts the
installer object with the Eiffel runtime and registers a populated
`XPACT_EiffelBridge` table through `XPACT_SetEiffelBridge`.
`XP_NATIVE_BRIDGE_EXPORT` is the Eiffel-side installer/export object that passes
its `$feature` routine addresses into that trampoline.

The bridge-only build from `scripts/build_native.ps1` still returns an explicit
`XML_ERROR_NOT_STARTED` failure rather than falling back to a C parser when no
Eiffel bridge has been installed.

`scripts/build_native_eiffel.ps1` packages the Eiffel-backed Windows native
library. It compiles the C export layer and Eiffel runtime trampoline, finalizes
`tests/xpact_native_library.ecf`, links the finalized Eiffel objects with
`xpact_eiffel_dllmain.c`, and produces `build/native-eiffel/xpact.dll` plus
`build/native-eiffel/xpact.lib`. The script then builds
`tests/native/xpact_eiffel_dll_smoke.c` as an external C caller and verifies
that `XML_Parse` reaches the Eiffel parser through the public `include/xpact.h`
ABI.

Linux/WSL packaging for an Eiffel-backed `libxpact.so` remains deferred
platform expansion. The current native release path is Windows x64, and the
Windows native benchmark already exercises the Eiffel-backed DLL through the
public C ABI.

`scripts/package_windows_release.ps1` creates the Windows-only release archive
under `dist/`. The archive contains `bin/xpact.dll`, `lib/xpact.lib`,
`include/xpact.h`, Windows release notes, checksum rows, benchmark/parity
documentation, and the C smoke source used to verify a consumer link.

`scripts/run_benchmarks.ps1` also measures that Windows DLL through the public
C ABI. It compiles `benchmarks/xpact_native_c_benchmark.c` with MSVC, links
against `build/native-eiffel/xpact.lib`, runs with `build/native-eiffel` on
`PATH`, publishes create/free and parser-reuse rows in `docs/benchmarks.md`,
and keeps the interpretation in `docs/performance-analysis.md`.

`tests/native/xpact_chunked_crc.c` is a diagnostic harness for the public
`XML_Parse` contract. It compiles against either xpact or system libexpat,
feeds the same XML through multiple chunk sizes, and records semantic CRC-32
event digests. It does not parse XML in C; it only observes callback streams
from the active parser implementation. Use `scripts/run_chunked_crc_harness.ps1`
to build and run it.
